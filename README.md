# Knitted Sensor Reader

## Introduction
This project contains the code and hardware setup for collecting data from knitted sensors. It includes simple examples of collected data with a 3x10 size sensor and a trained neural network for predicting the angle of the tested sensor. Additionally, code is provided for live evaluation for one or four sensors at a time with the trained neural network model.
